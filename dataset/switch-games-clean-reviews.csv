series finally handing receive one last blood injection legendary puzzle game myst thats pedigree vampire masquerade swansong tries live struggles piece identity detective rpg together end rich decisions feel meaningful theory emotional moments exist service broader story clue meanwhile many obtuse puzzles often clumsily explained working youd mortally forgiven walking swansongs dark hazy alcove final embracethings kick step fancy pair vampire shoes head camarilla upscale vampire court seated heart boston always treat get play clear villain story sadly isnt case instead swansong quickly positions downtrodden misunderstood hero grimdark underworld villains generic group heavily armed religious fanatics police uniforms unironically label second inquisition wasnt enough make eyes roll headed stanford guy whose monologues predictable onesided fails seen anything cheesy cartoon villain virtually every scene shows spouts euphemism ending vampire reign forever begins speaking latin gets dramatically ferried offscreen hold thought whole titular masquerade hiding existence vampires public exact reason better villain hed tweet themif dont already emotional investment vampire masquerades world swansong little pull first scene youre barraged jargonrich dialogue spoken characters already know whats going already history one another dont know none three playable characters leysha emem galeb really felt like though enjoy galebs general badassery hes camarillas point man youre familiar vampire masquerade bloodhunt galeb equivalent games ventrue enforcer class still isnt relatable good chunk time conversations feel like walking party everyone talks one talks three characters unique backstory related sit camarillas hierarchy least theyre decently voiceacted still jarring dropped directly stories full speed ahead without establishing stakes vampire world quickly threatened second inquisitionas result emotional connection cast vampires begins form last quarter swansongs hour story well youve already made decisions would determine characters fate worldbuilding certainly helped along lorerich codex take time read even spending significant time gaining understanding vampire underworld first legs story still rather uninspired uninteresting youve sufficient time shape around choicestheres shortage supernatural violence vampire masquerade swansong way youd normally expect rpg theres combat whatsoever cutscenes combat takes place scripted displays vampiric fighting prowess isnt death knell means since best rpgs get without need constant action unfortunately far bestdespite lack fighting still need sate characters bestial thirst specifically need maintain discipline bar like mana bar powers vampire abilities periodically sneak one several designated humans private spaces suck much blood without killing yawninducingly simple end killing mortal deliberately drinking two times suspicion gauge shared three characters goes gradually incur skill penalties bring back collecting loose pieces intel npc vampire comrades seem knack leaving around everywhereits almost always worth feeding human least replenish discipline since thats grants ability dominate tense conversations reveal hidden objects even teleport distant hidden locations depending youre playing likewise discipline pool goes hunger goes gradually making less capable tense encountersaside times get use vampire powers time swansong spent mundane things regular human couldve done begin mission limited pool willpower points spend hacking computers picking locks displaying flair rhetoric discussing finer points human blood would fine enough skill point system less punishing unbalanced unclear skill check system dominates dialogue confrontations instance certain cases critical conversation still result failure even youve spent enough precious willpower points display chance success menu thats meansfail states dont boot game screen cost experience points would able allocate following mission also tend change direction overarching story supposedly making later encounters challenging willpowerrestoring items far swansong easily slow halt fail enough interactions happen choose allocate experience points wrong skills level thats big problem since cant change respecialize skills find stuck front locked skill check unless youre willing restart level scratch making matters worse swansongs maps inconsistently designed functionally impossible know skills wont useful start crap shootits good theres always least one solution move story forward thats available characters map basic possible solution usually involves solving puzzle might trouble worth despite charming feet first several levels especially jefferson library jason moores apartment puzzlesolving detective work seemed appealing first glance quickly lost luster realized story wasnt ultimately interesting enough compel forward many riddles required several layers deductive reasoning solve didnt fit well themes story thus felt like padding rather interesting contextual challenges meant puzzle especially inconspicuous clues unrelated anything characters talking solutions could feel left field even werent entirely illogical many give little work often forced run around circles finally managed piece together theyre inherently bad simply doesnt gel pace storytellingat least reasonably spacious albeit contained environments look exceptionally good played max settings lighting fog effects look especially sleek art direction generally punchy giving distinct identity location camarilla especially cool explore layered contrasting black marble sharp red hues evoke sense otherworldly classy spaceyou might get used staring swansongs decorations longer time youd hoped though said earlier puzzles require high level deductive reasoning fine get little esoteric good instance one puzzle requires pay close attention direction certain mythical king pointing arms wont know without serious guesswork especially since clues placed immediately next completely different puzzle one later puzzles requires trace characters missing daughter military complex youll need translate single piece wellhidden information several layers logical deduction finding code printed sheet figuring thats supposed open finding another code forth find final solution move forward allthis type puzzle solving work right circumstances conflict already dreadfully slow pacing set swansongs slowburn story love compare style storytelling disco elysium arguably worked well got explore protagonists inner monologue stumbled problemsolving process however level selfawareness doesnt exist vampire masquerade swansong likewise often assumes youre paying close attention long stretches mindnumbingly dull dialogue swansong often hides clues plain sight since generally didnt know look already front given puzzle long dialogue scenes unskippable ended feeling like ploy pad swansongs length anything else

refreshing play game focused human political machinations one favorite characters introduced powerful sympathetic ordered war killed major good guys slowly started path redemption arc realized far theyd gone brutality would easy unfair compare triangle strategy game thrones many waysone hand four main characters triangle strategy suffer similarly boring young lord serenoa betrothed frederica advisor benedict best friend prince roland party members kind responsible excruciatingly painfully polite times dont seem baser instincts never swear lose temper express desire anything might seem fun even flashbacks older characters showing rowdy youth extent sometimes raced order see could follow orders efficiently rebellious genre filled flamboyant memorable characters games like fire emblem final fantasy persona almost shocking set main characters aggressively dullyet even character weakness mitigated triangle strategys strengths first plot participate ends stressing enough personality starts show even still universally positive responsible like fredericas intense need justice rolands love family bigger scales conviction system whenever house wolffort faces major choice instead asking us simply make serenoa seven main party members discuss vote votes binding go wishes time goes take importance future characters norzelia higher stakes make differences character motivations

choice system also deployed well crucial ways example one seemingly minor setting traits triangle strategy includes oppressed people called roselle whose historical religious oppression seemed directly inspired history jewish people way direct feel awkward real history real oppressed people given slight fantastical mask lead strange unpleasant paths triangle strategy consistently gave opportunity take action make life better roselle became relevant oppression wasnt mere window dressing make world seem darker realistic instead created storytelling opportunity still think roselle little weird especially physical trait pink hair definitely handled lot better id fearedthe quiet confidence triangle strategy even apparent combat system initially felt like perfectly generic tactical rpg campaign went increasingly impressed best level design difficulty tuning ive ever seen tactics gamethe combat form similar final fantasy tactics fire emblem party eight characters move

last long gets isolated traditional form one thats stood test time effective way provide strategic challenges players combined character distinctions personality shown actionsthere small tactical considerations built triangle strategy system enemies take damage certain spell types taking advantage terrain attacking higher ground hitting enemies behind damage small features dont add example combo system like disgaea goal create biggest exploits possibly triangle strategy progression system doesnt allow creating superpowered characters like final fantasy tactics anything like fire emblems friendship system encourage combat choices beyond simply damageinstead triangle strategy simpler quieter progression characters get slightly noticeably stronger ways allow temporary advantages tougher enemies also pick strengths cant completely reshape characters enough items progression choices via weapon upgrades tweak important ways noticed erador main heavy infantry character starting take massive magic damage upgraded magic defense able stand ground meanwhile every time thought found major advantage like picking powerful archer archibald watched enemy forces got strong enough previously thought overpowered became simply another useful strategythe tactics genre one balancing difficulty essential thats proven demonstrably tough much love xcom fire emblem three houses figuring difficulty level actually want consistent challenge major frustration cases extremely high praise say triangle strategy default normal setting provided exactly level difficulty wanted almost every turn got stuck harder fights interesting worthwhile optional battles could engage level bit else could experiment changing characters formation roster ah used ice mage set party left instead

five different nerf masters secure place among dont learn nerf masters isnt greater reason youre trying become nerf legend none childlike silliness story like could easily embraced instead youre told need robot makes corny jokes along way playing level wasnt bad enough owneach new area running three four repetitive obstacle courses fight swarms cliche robotic enemies solve braindead puzzles fight samey boss move next gauntlet chief among many gameplay atrocities youll endure godawful gunplay unsatisfying frustrating buggy pile mistakes one shooting nerf guns feels bad every weapon inaccurate wiggles around fire needs reloaded painfully slowly every couple seconds actually kinda close using real nerf guns also doesnt feel good fire bullets hard see barely make noise leave weapon hardly recognizable impact hit youre firing unless deal killing blow point enemy explodes pieceswhen played nerf guns kid id always imagined largerthanlife explosions emanating weapons exaggerated damage anything aimed look feel nerf gun plays fantasy hold one hands instead nerf legends finds way suck fun fantasy nerf making feel weak unwieldy incredibly mundane thats missed opportunity grew disappoint longer playedwhats even worse whatever reason attacking enemies melee hit actually one efficient ways take actually onehit kills robots oftentimes easier using guns since dont deal frustrating reload times thats remember fondly childhood nerf fights brothers melee attacks brilliantbelieve mess unsatisfying gunplay actually working intended regularly doesnt guns randomly lock letting fire bullets reload swap weapons swap back incredibly frustrating sometimes lose ability turn around aim weapons want odd glitch drags crosshair one corner another like ghost thumb jammed joystick happened solution found fix killing respawning unfortunately creates even issues dying tends break everything elsethats right sometimes youll die character never respawn instead youll find stuck eternal kill cam quit main menu reboot causes lose progress level normally dying fairly regular low stakes occurrence results immediate respawn practically negative repercussions times dying lost minutes progress due bug turn console walk offthe enemies fight level one upsetting aspects nerf misadventure fight handful robot creatures exactly none interesting enemies little robot spiders humanoids pepper bullets waddling around waiting killed occasionally youll find big roboscorpion giant mecha thats easier kill aim glowing weak spots novelty fights wears first appearance youll see whole lot levels go bythere also lots puzzles though using term puzzles extremely loosely sections amount standing area fighting unlimited waves enemies timer counts finding giant red buttons shooting gun open door hunting buttons actually enormous part spend time nerf legends almost every area big red forcefield wants find three five buttons immediate area moving theyre completely pointless searches add nothing except delay advance level like developers charging hour something get nerf game thats probably designed kids stuff like minecraft roblox indication hard imagine child hold controller finding puzzles even remotely compellingdid mention nerf legends worst sound design ive ever heard good lord auditory nightmare music consists almost exclusively repetitive guitar solos enemies beep boop speaking characters haunt cringeworthy performances whenever less health happens regularly hear loud heartbeat doesnt go away heal get guys low healthand worst every single time pick healing item happens constantly hear loud beeping noise fewer four times four like getting punched ears four times every couple seconds irritating actually preferred pick healing items even let die sometimes beeping doesnt happen respawn annoying unfortunately choose heal avoid beep get heartbeat sound choose preferred version hellthere also boss fights serve skill checks advance next part campaign practically nothing break persistent monotony fight enter ring humanoid youve gotta beat three times kill three times levels actually fail start unfortunately exception final boss barely interesting ninja moves like cloning copies boss encounters nothing separate normal combat boss wanders around shoots shoot back die couple minutes course issues gunplay still apply battles slightly higher stakesnerf legends also multiplayer mode precise doesnt one thats pvp literally doesnt work say literally mean genuinely functional try access multiplayer mode time tells arent connected internet locks entirely doesnt happen either tells lobbies exist join presumably one else playing asks make public lobby wait others join tried enter multiplayer match several hours day better part week different times day wasnt able play single match far tell reports others online well theres way get multiplayer work currently lets honest probably dodged foam dart anywaya complete lack functional multiplayer respawning upon death guns working correctly arent bugs youll find foamcovered catastrophe either long shot got hard crashes xbox dashboard cutscenes start middle reason lipsyncing characters thats several seconds sync enemies floating air arent supposed much dont even get started zipline system stalls air second every time attach one least smooth way possible often causes litany issues like able move character youve detached never able change weapon rest level using zipline got used zip lines causing issues seeing yellow lines distance gave anxiety fresh hell

995a3469,idea super smash brosstyle platform fighter brings together nickelodeons beloved cartoons across multiple generations one makes much sense kind wonder taken long something like nickelodeon allstar brawl come around despite nickelodeon allstar brawls clear inspirations developer ludosity made notable effort differentiate mechanics overall flow combat smash bros resulting fighter way faster smash game since melee puts allstar brawl great spot alternative smash ultimate thats available practically every platform subpar use wealth source material along general lack polish irksome mechanics mean recommendation comes without significant caveatsthe first thing comes across playing allstar brawl feels like game made pretty tight budget character models backgrounds lack detail original themes made level extremely generic theres one barebones singleplayer arcade mode barely worth mentioning sports mode zero meaningful unlockables progression rewards outside images songs jukebox perhaps damning thing despite game celebrating nickelodeons finest theres little nickelodeon charm comes theres voice acting remixes themes many cartoons featured stages littered fun easter eggs fans discover feels kind soullessits impressive comefrombehind victory allstar brawl still really fun actually play follows basic formula platform fighters removing life bars favor damage percentages get hit higher damage percentage youll go flying every hit youre kod opponent knocking stage unless turn critical kos means two key things potentially killed taking hardly damage could survive even taking enormous amount punishment really exciting style action feels like always chance make miraculous comeback even youre multiple livesthis style fighting game really comes alive party environment three friends allstar brawl different super easy pick given minimal instructions play good time regardless experience level said developers clearly huge smash fans theyve designed deeper mechanics behind approachable coat paint hardcore fans games mindwhere allstar brawl sets apart primarily movement exceptionally fastpaced facilitated high run speeds speedy recoveries attacks unique air dash functions recovery option wavedash fastfall one air dash allows dash left right quick substantial boost horizontal momentum still perform actions direction downwards even larger burst speed downside specifically air dash air dodge means theres invulnerability frames itits tradeoff worth making though love extra mobility given every character thanks unique take traditional airdodge mechanic allows unpredictable approaches greatly aids characters would otherwise struggle immensely recoveries trying get back stage big hit works great tool play mind games opponent keep guessing might dothere also number smaller mechanical differences help establish allstar brawls identity platform fighter genre theres rolling spot dodging way avoid taking damage hit blocking negating attack one instead smash attacks strong attacks performed air every character throw allows pick opponent move around tossing unless opponent able mash graspwhile appreciate ways allstar brawl tries different fan mechanics especially dont like characters basically throw really like throw mechanics general looks janky easy mash low percentages feels like cheap ko high percentages worst giving unique animations character throws feels like missed opportunity add personality movelist also diversifying playstyles may look quite good enough really flood brain nostalgia chemicals allstar brawls cast characters largely great design point view healthy mix obvious must haves interesting oddballs might immediately spring mind think iconic nicktoons end pretty inspired choices like nigel thornberry whose eccentric moveset involves mimicking attacks poses various animals hilarious effectthere definitely glaring omissions like characters rockos modern life angry beavers fairly oddparents name allinall fairly admirable starting roster characters primarily covers decent spread nicktoons early classics like rugrats hey arnold megahits like avatar last airbender legend korra loud house sole

attack alters properties moves wish every character spike move aerial lightdown attack since powerful finisher giving characters already super strong feels like overkill characters moves eyebrowraisingly close whats found smash bros aside issues everybody roster feels quite distinct one anotherwhat doesnt feel distinct multiple people pick character whatever reason alternate colors costumes characters youre playing four reptars thing distinguishes opponents small icon one make hard figure immediate glance especially larger stageseach character comes stage total pretty decent number arenas except consider number stages youll actually want visit probably much lower whether youre playing competitively casually gimmicky stages arent fun fight youre often going stage youre going friends try keep rapidly moving tiny platforms space madness stage avoid roller coaster cars two solid bits land glove world stage name two frustrating examples types levels arent anything new dont kind visual spectacle makes sort sacrifice worth itthe handful stages worth playing ones youve probably come expect relatively flat straightforward standins smashs iconic final destination battlefield smashville said gimmick levels nightmare pretty fun given right circumstances showdown teeter totter gulch level rugrats personal favorite mine teetering central platform isnt intrusive provides nice change pace even though little hard get kills enormous size powdered toast trouble level packed fun interactables ren stimpy easter eggsperhaps secret weapon nickelodeon allstar brawl online play rollback netcode experience relatively smooth part certainly bad matches especially certain levels like rooftop rumble stage ive numerous issues playing online vast majority online matches without issues definitely guilty gear strive terms quality netcode least good enough comfortably say one area allstar brawl clear advantage smash ultimate

sprawling jungle crawl lots little dungeons sprinkled around act however boring dirt npcs dont flavor dialogue let alone personality quests areas entirely linear idea story invading hell could boring diablo somehow thankfully things pick lord destruction expansions act bit rushed good timei chose paladin seven available classes first character grand return diablo two decades ive maintained personal grudge dung beetle soldiers act know ones poop lightning hit paladins lightning resistance aura allows laugh faces kill humiliating ways everything thought could bethats part charm diablo

poison attack bringing back present applies damageovertime effect devastating resultsyou might think early examples would small sampling interesting ways one might manipulate time advantage reality far mechanics ever go first handful tutorial encounters youll experienced nearly tricks book use thereafter becomes matter repeating painfully monotonous effect twists turns along way massive missed opportunity compared well time travel used outside combateven enjoy overused time manipulation tricks combat offers taking advantage rarely best way get encounters anyway sure could apply burn enemy throw future theyre torched crisp would could oneshot elemental attack instead usually takes multiple steps make use time travel combat combine different effects like payoffs dont actually reward extra effort could attacking instead result ended using rare cases made sense particular fight demanded itcombat encounters dont repeat time travel tricks either also reuse enemy types simple enemies like wolves slimes given fresh coat paint elemental remix area thrown path time time combine reused time manipulation gimmicks frequent random encounters youve got recipe one mindlessly grindy jrpgs

times shockingly fast hunts capcom also deserves special shoutout making online system works letting join lobbies switch friends little hassle thats become frustratingly infrequent standard living switch looking animal crossingi impressed immediate variety monsters rise throws using straightforward variation older key quest system let pick wide variety hunts right away requiring complete set handful choice youre able move next tier story damned flexibility greatly appreciated drawback variety monsters also feels like peaks quicker result plenty fight seemed like also seen bulk time

monster variety leave rise feeling touch flatter last half initially anticipated visuals power level example little surprised find basically didnt need switch simple insect glaive ore tree hilariously looks like rifle nearly high rankjust every weapon monster hunter rise touched tweaked way big small playing alongside igns wikis team plenty experience across sorts weapons almost exclusively use insect glaive lot changed weapon relative recent appearance world might seem surface since many folk like simply stick main choice figured id break bit arent interested safely skip aheadwhile glaives initial moveset largely unchanged world switch skills let alter certain attacks fairly significant impact combos choose use fan alternative options swap slower big hits rapid attacks appeals playstyle enjoy since glaives agility one favorite things plus one draw attack lets spin forward flurry blows automatically throws air dodge get hit attacking dang funand glaives silkbind moves initially struck uninteresting aerial maneuvers weapon arguably needs least one bound zla became absolute staple hunts basically emergency dodge button ridiculously large invincibility window letting deal damage longer still get away clean shame zlx option less useful acting way leap fight prefer use rises signature new wirebug system defensively silkbind switch skill unlock high rank unfortunately swapped one actually usebut drastic changes glaive received actually kinsects accompany kinsect nurturing gone instead youll simply unlock bug varieties buy progress kinsect level assigned glaive determines stats kinsect types also split three different categories powder type auto attack leave detonatable clouds behind speed charge arm dealing extra damage first hit sent assist attack alongside three

weaker monsters save time hand spending five ten minutes start hunts following trail birds order max stats become different type tedious begin miss simply selecting additional buffs wanted directly meals ultimately interesting experiment takes advantage rises enhanced movement one wouldnt miss nearly much movement itselfi get similar feeling newly expanded monster riding system equal parts cool insane dealing damage certain attacks another monster lays pain eventually put monster rideable state unlike previous games monster still ravenous unwieldy rise gives complete control pilot like dog ram walls even use light heavy attacks combo parry system thats surprisingly nuanced timings lot time letting drive monsters way across map order kaiju battle another one dropping extra materials doling serious damageits absolute blast side effect monsters map transformed beasts feared tools used gone thrilling moments another monster shows unexpectedly throws monkey wrench fight hilarious fashion maybe people happy lack chaos makes monsters barely different tiny endemic life waiting picked little strange copious ways easily ride lure monsters fights wasnt uncommon use three four different monsters beat actual target course minute hunt thats exciting also means rajang used fear little club wielded notorious deviljho bazelguese arent rise honestly sure imposing interruptions would even work herethis feeling persists bit rises new rampage hunts rampages basically weird blend monster hunter tower defense game letting setup ballistas cannons defend gates waves monsters odd fun novelty thing reminiscent past siege fights like kulve taroth significantly customizability lot less pressure monsters plow toward gate significantly weaker usual youll spend decent amount rampage turret peppering bolts bombs even machine gun fire rather ground weapon neat change paceits entertaining side mode one greatly benefits party friends share multitasking madness base defense one person could man turret another sets new defenses third shovels coal kiln reduces cooldown powerful superweapons like recognizable dragonator essentially aerial nuke ive certainly enjoyed completing rampages also dont change much run run really modified variety straightforward subgoals increase final score like stunning certain number monsters four possible stronghold layouts defend monsters attacking might change visually khezu basarios basically break gate way real return draw taking superstrong apex monsters cap high rank rampages eventually wished could fight field instead tower defense song dance appearedthat said rampages reward time fairly well offering smattering crafting materials every type monster present boatload defender tickets used customize weapons new system called rampage skills allowing tweak choice one three additional bonuses could simple stuff like increasing attack defense affinity also offer unique effects like increasing damage weapon dulls dealing damage airborne enemies among things rampage skills also accompanied nifty rampage weapon type basically blank slate onto apply three rampage skills instead one letting design custom tool destructioncouple customizability another new system called switch skills lets weapon swap specific moves alternate ones rise returns previous playstyle nuance world streamlined away choices generally didnt clear correct answer although sure minmaxers figure optimal combination long presenting choices like swapping strong overhead strike fast forward spin emphasizing personal preference pure power seem three switch skills per weapon one silkbind move thats least enough change weapon handles noticeable wayits shame rise currently lacks sort endgame really push limits choice offers took hours see basically everything see finish story thats certainly short still optional quests unlock improved meal options switch skills weapons rise ends unsatisfying cliffhanger feels like missing last layer really test disappointed see theres additional challenges unlocked reach point tempered monsters replayable area like icebornes guiding lands elder dragons monster hunters challenging exciting adversaries apart couple fought special encounters avoiding spoilers least extremely coolcouple relatively flatfeeling equipment progression rise ends looking like excellent foundation capcom build upon rather deep

things way something like monster hunter worlds kulve taroth siege witcher crossovers pretty much meant updates never sank hooks long thankfully least still lot funthere also gameplay things see

menacing apex monsters available fight regular locales similarly spiribird monsterriding mechanics certainly enjoyed little bit split almost entirely ignored larger community far tell nearly random players ive queued last year dont engage hunts whatsoeverthat said rise still absolute blast glad run well pc far id certainly recommend anyone enjoyed monster hunter world steam updates didnt build

allowing cloned tasking players wrangling several portly plumber levels generally contain standalone microchallenges short single room set pieces one done often way super mario worlds true scope full

impressive amount variety worlds suite cat suit animations also lovingly composed mario doesnt need wiggle bum pounces instance move much better small detail thats one manythat said playing super mario world gameplay actually feels like bit awkward fit presentation levels viewed fixed perspectives often shifted left right generally limited depth giving path follow much room move within unfortunate knockon effectsdespite sharing design principles super mario galaxy instance world feels lot staid course theres pretty big difference mario running way around planetoids levels hes

dioramalike design showcase systems screen worked wonderfullyon console rather different story without depth perception enabled screen forced viewpoint makes spatial awareness harder judge would purely design game full camera control world doesnt feel intuitively precise mario gamesthis feeling compounded throw additional players mix yes like new super mario bros games wii wii u switch four people quest together case choosing mario luigi princess peach toad eventually rosalina result chaotic fun also haphazard levels challenges simply dont work well four people running around

tension fantastic one minute id leave powerup friend help next id pick try toss mapone places fails however shared pool lives runs prematurely ends fun lives long one player remains solid ground cant

negative positive rare youd want use toad instance fast cant jump high luigi tricky theres lot going need judge larger jump fact skids stop rosalina hand broadly better spin attack gate basically double jump yes shes slowest yes shes character lose core abilities shes wearing suit still shes always first draft pickthe solution would simply let multiple people use character put different

breath wilds backstory life make lumbering titans feel real ever beforeperhaps significant new twist however also likely divisive opening cutscene introduces us miniature guardian comes alive moment zeldas powers awaken hope lost travels back time warn heroes come guardian adorable sure timetraveling motif naturally raises question whether prequel follow events described breath wild whether create timeline altering pastim going directly answer question story discover say many events transpire theres plenty highstakes drama actual characterisation along way pretty lacking zelda instance spends big chunk time playing one note played memories breath wild namely selfdoubt shell ever unlock power useful disappointing shes played straight opportunity well main characters actuallythis especially awkward battle zelda straightup brawler wields sheikah slate primary weapon yet badass killing machine still meek bookish lacking confidence far story concerned theres even escort mission

224d9267,super mario bros battle royale game didnt know needed life whatever reason never got around playing tetris super mario bros released eshop downloading within minutes entire gaming life leading experience super mario bros forced rethink approach game ive played countless times people experience alone endeared super mario bros stoking fire competitiveness kept hooked said definitely saw diminishing returns approached hour eight playtime past weekendthe premise simple play super mario bros know game pretty much everyone entire planet played one packed nintendo entertainment system one youre playing players varying levels skill trying knock winnowing field rightful winner claim victoryits simple probably think though first match ran fast could level avoiding enemies powerups attempt beat clock wrong time management important speeding alone isnt win thats one thing really liked early experience super mario bros extra systems layered top original meant build strategy scratch need strike balance speed collecting coins fill item roulette wheel spin costs coins collecting powerups defeating enemies increase time meteryoure given five choices want defeated enemies go right stick lets pick random player coins player least amount time remaining players whove sent enemies recently left stick lets select whichever player want use left stick advantage quite lot selecting player particularly tricky level spamming enemies knock theyre vulnerable like able control wave defeated foes end used strategically great way ruin someone elses run overwhelming enemiessuper mario bros made rethink entire approach super mario brosdefeating enemies also gives time bonus depending defeat example shooting enemy fireball gives mere extra second jumping gives two seconds bounce land another enemy youll get three seconds chain bounces keep adding time highest ive gotten already fire flower collect another thats seconds extra defeating bowser another seconds added sends bowser someone elses level make extra annoying great touch lets turn lemons lemonade level example getting brunt someones defeated foes turn crisis opportunity load timerdefeating enemies increase time meter another way super mario bros made rethink entire approach super mario bros rather running past goombas trapped columns jump every single one likely send koopa shell flying enemies rack extra time traditionally overwhelming deluge goombas would initially cause anxiety see opportunity max time meterit took games realize important coins time early developed strategy id spend majority run banking time coins helps enormously comes one player remaining experimenting figuring without onscreen prompt protip dialogue kind thing live cant speak anyone elses strategy works discovering method gain competitive advantage enormously satisfyingwhen youre final five competitiors super mario bros shinesgetting final five competitors sounds alarm quite literally classic almost time melody plays music tempo speeds werent already stressful enough try navigate playfield super mario shines played many matches came one player usually becomes battle attrition final two matchup sometimes lasts longer time took knock get unbelievably stressful even earliest castles become challenge theyre filled enemies wouldnt otherwise ive come second place panicked missed jump made boneheaded move extra pressure makes seizing victory phenomenal rush losing fantastic disappointment kept coming back againbut thats doubleedged sword whatever two edges mushroom kingdom one hand first always felt need play one round regardless whether came first second even lower hand holy cow sick world onset match vote level start think count one finger times wasnt world please friends beg pick different start level cant keep going like thisi also cant quite figure levels work youre actually playing like traditional super mario bros clearing takes fact sometimes clearing takes sometimes clearing takes back even famous warp zone end switched instead normal world selections get random assortment levels one occasion mix according stage select screen ive cleared world times thats many twice many clears next mostplayed level world repetition early levels super mario bros definitely makes feel less superthis repetition early levels super mario bros definitely makes feel less super winning another round last night didnt feel urgency return try get backtoback win feeling burned somewhat disinterested running umpteenth time theres thrill unlocking new levels know youre rarely going see allthere daily challenges like defeat enemies shell player battle well special battle adds different conditions set playlist levels little change things example might start coins magic mushroom run levels thats itbut similar battle royale powerhouses pubg fortnite prize winning satisfaction job well done thats oh get coins points level sure dont really change anything next time play coins earned winning used buy powerups start new match coins point fire flower powerup would reasonably want anyway costs mere leveling gets new icons slap user profile players see end matchim trying downplay thrill victory enormously satisfying outwit outlive opponents downright cathartic especially youre someone equal skill standing second feeling like hour pure stress thats mostly okay sure would nice could show much ive strike little twinge respect fear competitors see coming

franchise passable enough trigger pavlovian response love tactics games dark crystal series left wanting regards really saw offerin interest avoiding spoilers ill say dark crystal tactics covers general plot arc age resistance show like stranger things game many missions pulled right sequences show new welldrawn comicstrip cutscenes retell key scenes flair despite story told pales comparison tv version moments interactive handdrawn truncated ways seem tailored elicit memories watched show rather actually tell story clear nods age resistance plot moves far quickly strings dialogue shown world map missions found difficult follow even watching first episodes started playingas result even centerpiece moments like boss fights prominent skeksis show feel hollow key characters gelfling skeksis otherwise get chance stand spotlight theres next time spent character development arent excited sight alone controlling fighting isnt going add much equation even allowing liberties take condensing full season plot roughly tohour combatfocused video game version story feels like hurried summary youd get friend hits crucial details enticing times never captures emotion important momentssetting aside capacity dark crystal fan service dark crystal tactics also evoked bit nostalgia tactical rpgs particularly original playstationera games like final fantasy tactics vandal hearts though art style retro means got muddy overly rendered look thats functional stylish turnbased combat laden rpgstyle abilities tiled maps full environmental hazards gimmicks definitely dark crystal tactics gets basics experience right strong emphasis using skills get upper hand enemies likely beat trade blows someone diesmore many strategy rpgs dark crystal tactics also emphasizes turn order timing means controlling battle long bar top screen shows next character turns helping predict enemies movements plan ahead also decent number skills allow move allys next turn push enemys back giving ability take stock turn order manipulate advantage character also refrain attacking using ability speed next turn cleverly incentivizes careful play taking wild swings predicting enemy behavior cornerstone tactics strategy games dark crystal tactics puts front centerbut combat offer interesting decisions even best dragged poorly designed menus take far longer navigate cannot example cycle characters jobs equipment menus instead must select character choose aspect loadout alter one one combat select move radial menu move rather clicking character works nearly game genre inefficiencies combined fairly long load times switch make navigating menus battle tedious point sometimes avoided tinkering partys skills save slogthe dark crystal tactics greatest strength progression clearly smallerscale riff job system final fantasy tactics addition level gelfling podling fighters gains stats abilities choosing leveling class job though job tree small classes adhere broad roles like mender healer paladin offensefocused melee fighter theres lot room customization person squad choose finite number skills three current primary job two secondary job time character hits job level threshold advancing theyll learned way three skills choose skills fit role teammoreover classes complementary feature little overlap theres always strong incentive stay lower class rather absentmindedly advancing ladder since bring four five people fight impossible create flawless team need assemble character loadouts eye towards specific sets skills overall gameplan skills combinehowever system works better theory practice strict loadout limitations skills become infinitely better others limiting character rotation greatly example many powerful attack abilities soldiers like double strike require mark enemies first mark basic scout ability compelled keep scout job primary secondary one two characters times found wishing access abilities particularly passive movementrelated skills theyre never essential grew rely onover time new battle conditions force mix things even causes frustration youll run bosses immune status effects usually inflict poison swamps demand skills cure debuffs beach maps rising tides require extra speed also plenty missions require focus objective combat like getting team exit freeing gelfling prisoners cages push balance engaging enemy achieving goals none twists interesting creative appreciated commitment environmental mechanics theme missions keep things fresh hand commitment sometimes lead boring situations id spend dozen extra turns slowly moving objective even defeating enemiesin perfect world entire character roster would leveled properly equipped times allow swap different fighters match situation however since characters level combat bringing someone skill unexpectedly need requires lot grinding optional battles whip backups shape rarely feels worth significant effort required instead found trying rejigger default five six squad members best ability whenever level hard counter usual gameplanthough wasnt insurmountable issue every setback dark crystal tactics feels like disproportionately big inconvenience outside laborious menus dark crystal tactics also somehow relies exclusively autosave system provide way quicksave middle battle switch always pause putting console sleep save reverts last time world map quit retrying mission death quit since theres easy option restart requires sit multiple loads lead lot downtime get stuckfor another netflix show tiein game watch stranger things

dynamaxing doesnt require pokemon hold item makes team flexible mega evolution zmoves though personally like aesthetics wild changes mega evolution offered pokemon dynamaxing though least gigantamax

credits roll roughly hours inwhile sword shield arent among bestlooking games switch first mainline pokemon games play bigscreen tv certainly dont look bad either fact compared previous pokemon games look fantastic theres sign framerate stutter common ds battles new unique attack animations really damn cool nintendo doesnt want us talk detail quite yet take word really stand older moves stiff plainand cutscenes nice enough disappointed continued lack emotion characters face rivals companions well stakes story get pretty extreme character mindlessly smiling along animations also stiff like older attack animations graphics undoubtedly best weve ever seen pokemon rpg still havent quite matched rpgs switch elsewhere top theres noticeable popin wild pokemon items small quirks still never disrupted play things considered gameplay charm important raw visual pageantry qualities sword shield spadestheres lot consternation community fact sword shield first pokemon games include national pokedex means wont able transfer total preexisting pokemon every previous generation one youve beaten campaign thats bummer especially completionists clear difference means work way previous games wouldnt affect initial playthrough previously national dex exclusively available endgame either due story progression limitations late introduction pokemon bank pokemon bank patchas evident video initial reaction also negative news played consider mind changed course still super disappointed cant transfer shiny absol thats near dear heart sword shield see muchimproved switch graphical style beautiful red disaster pokemon postgame isnt dealbreaker plenty pokemon sword shield rest pokemon wait old games pokemon bank pokemon home launches early yes still stuck maybe theres something said ash leaving previous team behind moves new regionbeyond countless little touches longtime pokemon player wholeheartedly appreciate tiny things like team healed automatically gym battle could seamlessly continue story able switch pokemon box midroute able connect seamlessly others using ycomm make big difference add tweaks like make feel like pokemon finally adapting player behavior

1fae2291,original nintendo switch longer feels like proper portable device ive used switch lite new slimmeddown version reminds game boy advance look feel offering cheaper attractive way play switchs incredible library go course comes cost signature ability dock play tv sacrificing whole lot flexibility play lite cant actually switch certainly mode stuck well enough satisfy anybody looking replace aging nintendo ds fact playing game handheld mode anyway id rather switch lite fullfledged switchi impressed first moment took lovely yellow switch lite box also currently available gray turquoise grown even love little tweaks improvements ive used last week clean matte finish surprisingly light weight oz original oz feels great hands point clunkier patchwork body regular switch attached joycon suddenly much obvious couple weeks agowatch unboxing nintendo switch lite video belowwhile lites screen certainly smaller inches originals inch screen doesnt really feel way playing got used right away barely noticed instead went back regular switch screen suddenly felt noticeably large thats small distinction means lites size quickly appears natural reduced even though games already problem hardtoread text like fire emblem three houses dragon quest builders certainly still issue lite doesnt make worse way feared mightthe lcd screen lovely tell games seem play pretty much original performancewise graphics even looking marginally improved times due slightly higher pixel density comes p resolution crammed smaller space appreciated bezel around lites screen slightly slimmer thanks part absence joycon tracks sidehowever one drawback slim body ive already encountered comes speakers sound comparable enough original quality volume higher levels cause certain music ingame audio vibrate entire device like ringing phone little ironic lite doesnt builtin controller rumble huge issue obviously goes away entirely youre using headphones genuinely annoying fingertips constantly buzzing playing small subset gameson topic headphones little aggravating lite portable device released support bluetooth headphones without adapter odd omission switch came two years ago even confusing mobilefocused iteration certainly buy thirdparty usbc dongle anywhere lets pair headset tried one built original switch worked fine fact youre still forced seems like poor choicewill lite first switch favorite games itin plus column buttons built lite tangible improvement regular joycon joysticks shoulder buttons nearidentical face buttons sharper edges depress little farther making satisfyingly tactile use allnew dpad replaces left joycons directional buttons also fantastic addition doesnt clickiness dpads like xbox one controller switch pro controller far better thirdparty switch option ive tried let thumb roll easily directions precision platformer like celeste lite may upgrade original terms power constructionthe controls dont hold well motion controls still work fine smaller movements like aiming bow breath wild joycon detach means activities like shaking roll faster super mario odyssey zeldas already annoying motioncontrol shrine puzzles totally suck shaking whole system physically turning sideways cant even see screen makes parts games borderline unplayableyou course sync separately purchased wireless controllers whether joycon pro controllers thirdparty options far usable setup without builtin kickstand youll still need prop lites screen way hold controller hands similarly lites inability dock tv makes coop games single system struggle theoretically still play single lite sure ill ever want play things like overcooked super smash bros ultimate mario kart deluxe four people crowding around even smaller screenobviously thats spinoff system designed without hybrid nature original lite proper handheld treated certain games run new model doesnt necessarily mean playing thats made doubly apparent joyconcentric games like super mario party snipperclips using lone sideways joycon play context buying pair joycon top lite would nearly equal price regular switch meanwhile cardboard labo accessories entirely incompatible liteheres prerelease video breaking five games could problems litestill idea device legitimately small enough fit pocket condolences cursed tiny pockets womens pants able play massive games like breath wild skyrim doom soon even witcher incredible may dedicated handheld one access amazing game library stretching far beyond wed previously thought possible device like sure performance playability may vary compared powerful consoles donethere missing features things like rumble autobrightness adjustment largely minor annoyances battery life slightly better launch switch disappointingly shorter newly revised version recently replaced decent unremarkable three seven hours depending game little drawbacks dont outweigh improvements made ultimately playing handheld mode id rather lite sacrifice tv mode entirely benefitsome may already base switch wondering whether lovely little thing could make good companion really comes personal decision since apart smaller better buttons including swanky new dpad lite isnt really proper upgrade terms powerwhile using single nintendo account across two different switches relatively easy keep mind come annoyances youll need register one primary switch whichever one dont essentially treated always online requirement play nonphysical copies games although change one whenever wantconfused switch cloud saves heres could affect youyour primary switch continue play downloaded games go usual secondary switch require internet connection verify arent simultaneously using account elsewhere still play cartridges offline problem primarily download youll likely want leave original switch connected internet home make lite primary easier onthego gamingadditionally cloud saves nintendo switch online service work well easily sync two systems games like splatoon upcoming animal crossing new horizons dont support feature find details switch accounts cloud saves nintendo switch wiki pagesit worth noting however lite doesnt solve also doesnt make worse base models lingering annoyances considering cheap memory days wish version gb builtin storage though easily use sd card expand usual also gets fairly worryingly warm times like original still lacks basic console features like internet browser netflix app way manually organize games home screen first two far less egregious handheldonly device still strange oversight nowadayson top looming threat switchs nownotorious joystick drift havent experienced lite already small number reports folks seen lites joysticks start drifting slightly one side way joysticks joycon known real concern one nintendo thankfully good fixing free since became widely known issue shipping whole system repair lot less convenient single joycon free idea nintendo potentially didnt take lite opportunity permanent fix problem frankly baffling

fighting since doesnt take much control stick two buttons access fighters moveset unlike street fighters mortal kombats tekkens world arent complicated inputcombos beyond pressing b along single direction making simple learn character playing around instead look move lists spend time practice modethe fact fighters dont health bars gives smash bros rare accessibility keeps high skill cap feeling intimidating instead wearing opponents life increasing percentage higher goes easier smash away strong attack knocking map entirely gets ko still scary high percentage system avoids depressive feeling little hit dead pointless traditional fighting games sometimes cause health drops sliver smash bros ultimate feels like youve still got fighting chanceand accessibility important looking technical nuance find plenty dodges grabs shield timings veritable ballet midair movement strategy mention changes different abilities attacks even weights every character fast tiny character like pichu feels wildly different hardhitting bowser learning subtleties playing vital theres deep well combos counterplay want dive feels like nintendo actively aware supportive side smash bros beforenone

edition means due many wii us wouldnt surprised many people playing latest iteration missed last smash bros entirely ultimate doesnt lean assumption crutch leaves essentially part previous design untouchedfighters ultimate feel little bit faster lot harder hitting overall launching enemy smash attack feels bit like punching balloon fighters flying away faster losing speed quicker means theres often less ambiguity whether hit turn ko fewer frustrating moments slowly drift toward unexpected death theres even radar appears player screen show relation edge view edge destruction addition liked turned dontin oneonone fights two fighters remain theres seriously epic freezeframe zoom effect land hit almost certainly result ko similar already happened little macs ko punch alone makes big smash attacks even satisfying makes even clearer someone actually chance recover hard hit notmany final smash attacks made easier handle well inconsistent ones like pacman pikachu donkey kong changed hit reliably final smashes lock enemies animation guaranteed damage common across board makes feel like less imbalance playing smash balls almost frustratingly hard catch introduction optional final smash meter slowly charges weaker version move offers completely new way weave exciting finishers matchthankfully dont want play smash bros way ultimate made significantly easier adjust rules match make custom rulesets save reselect whenever youd like one default preference one using final smash meter one items stage hazards one items pok balls many wanted saving rulesets godsend dont keep making big

additions switch classic returning levels also visually touched look absolutely fantastic particularly fourside corneria meleestill bad apples bunch confused made cut others didnt pretty much good thing truly terrible stages like pacland great cave offensive bring party interesting skins omega battlefield variations map pool would stronger whole without dragging averagesimilarly cool new items

ubiquitous super mario bros obscure japanonly game boy game kaeru tame ni kane wa naru every one represented piece art source material miss detailed trophies past smash bros games ludicrously large

rathalos particular recreated feeling game far faithfully expected first chase rathalos around dungeon map nest could use pitfall deku nut items trap stun deal damage extremely cool even wasnt overly difficult point campaignand thats sort world light overall amusing enjoyable extremely detailed also pretty thin spirit fights neat quantity downright unbelievable difference fighting spirit board map one gives access abilities incredibly strong skill tree problem isnt directly campaigns length lack significant change time stands nintendo likely could trimmed five hours fat compelling adventure mode itthat makes little sad undoubtedly enjoyable surprises worth experiencing buried amongst tidal wave spirits difficult access last hour world light particular one greatest video game finales ive

switchs tablet casing feels like cut close bone possible without going small starts harm good inches wide four inches tall isnt exactly pocketsized smaller screen would start getting uncomfortably

inches deep wide tall switch also needlessly big compared thirdparty options front dock covers entire screen poor design decision nintendos part scratch switch arent careful dock sock popular stopgap solution solution annoyance shouldnt exist thirdparty docks popped offer slimmer less scratchy options reports permanently bricking switch used prolonged periods nintendo warned us use official dock makes sense fundamentally frustrating official dock alternatives fixes made availablewhether docked handheld ive fallen love design switchs joycon controllers theyre available variety decorative colors ones box either gray blue red default extras alternatives usually cost set used attachments either side tablet attached included joycon grip handle form something resembling traditional wireless gamepad independently charge simply connected tablet theyll last lengthy hours long enough didnt need think oftenwhile using single sideways joycon still cramped comfort excited use two joycon together pretty much every game personally enjoy using unconnected one hand similar wii remote nunchuk without clunky cable love able casually hold arms position want playing games motion

otherwise think shape layout buttons comfortable everything undoubtedly smaller giving joysticks buttons bit less action ps xbox one controller still feel responsive satisfying press joycons hd rumble feature capable extremely precise vibrations makes feedback substantial biggest hindrance triggers digital instead analog meaning dont subtle range motion would useful things like racing games let

like switch labo creations like robot piano kits neat doesnt really feel like adds much substance systemmeanwhile theres notable omission joycon headphone jack located switchs tablet none controller like found current ps xbox one controllers combined also disappointing lack option use wireless bluetooth headsets switch without dongle means difficult play quietly dockedthat lack headset ties another troubling issue since microphone switch way communicate firstparty multiplayer games like mario kart splatoon using nintendos android ios app legitimately one inconvenient baffling design decisions ive ever seen major console maker come left confusedly trying figure listen phone switch time nintendos official solution buy proprietary splatoon splitterdongle thing turns switch mess

switch theyve still got ways gothere handful physical design flaws cropped wear tear last year half well largely issues one could predicted launch one common reports switchs battery expanding slightly warping back case sometimes cracking plastic isnt something ive personally experienced seen firsthand luckily seems generally cosmetic issueone experienced switch latch holding left joycon onto side

worried could eventually lock closed even come entirely things like make nervous systems durability switch look like two years nowthe switch comes gb internal storage pretty small fair switch games dont take huge amount space splatoon gb super mario odyssey around gb though breath wild much larger gb enough cover downloads awhile eventually ran space buy micro sd card add via slot kickstand expand switchs storage capacity gb imagine people need one point unless youre buying physical games though even games like doom require healthy installation size want play multiplayer means necessity gatethe pro controller another pricey peripheral option conventional design makes excellent option games like fortnite require bit precision know people also prefer two joycon included grip many

surprising variety official controller optionsthis one systems greatest feats brought meaningful choice preference console controllers way thats gimmicky steering wheel shell though may agree playing

53894d8f,valkyria chronicles comes sega trying get series back track returning roots leaning heavily made first valkyria chronicles good years ago thats mostly good thing latest entry adds new mechanics balance changes make feel like rehash even first games issues make notsowelcome return welltheres strategy game quite like valkyria chronicles describing mishmash genres sound like someone took throws dart board covered game types hoped would work jrpg set colorful alternatereality world war deep turnbased tactical battles units controlled semirealtime thirdperson shooter combat like said extremely weird paper works extraordinarily well practiceput simply valkyria chronicles feels like tactics anime theres huge focus story told campaign enjoyable part roughly hours took conquer compelling melodramatic visual novelstyle dialogue animated cutscenes tell exciting story squad e atlantic federation fighting imperial alliance fights play tactical battles use command points take direct control soldiers fieldthose battles really make valkyria chronicles much fun battlefields fairly large often dotted dozens enemy units making fun challenge keep track multiple engagements time six different soldier classes ranging fastmoving scouts slow tankbusters called lancers fortified enemy bunkers destroy even tanks control massive amount options given fighti loved surveying battlefield beginning every match enthusiastically playing role commander tactician plotted strategies attack routes good tactical puzzle rewards thinking ahead multiple turns punishes severely considering opponent might counterattack turn movei overjoyed see valkyria chronicles return sprawling maps first game opposed smaller interlinked areas second entry really seems recognize made first special appreciated longtime fan maybe could bit ambitious additions everything added changed undoubtedly improvementmost notably valkyria chronicles didnt bring back original five classes added brand new one grenadier grenadiers allow drop longrange explosions enemy units ton fun command open new strategies simply werent available previous games example blindly fire guess shots test areas behind buildings hills hiding enemies proves true often enough grenadiers quickly became staple squadi also found presence alone got use engineer units significantly first game engineers essentially weaker versions scouts repair tanks refill ammo pairing one grenadier meant could constantly top mortar ammo fire significantly rounds turnthat strategy fun discover refine borderline gamebreakingly powerful unlocked new type mortar grenadiers deals extra damage tanks extended range ability hit tanks weak spot without walk behind essentially made lancer units obsolete even managed win huge climactic boss fight stronger tank enemy toward end campaign single grenadier single turn walking range repeatedly pelting radiator bombscheap strategies like arent new problem valkyria chronicles though old exploits actually counteracted somewhat example scouts still used rush mission quickly capturing camps mission objectives level layouts time around mean thats always youre going win fact exploitative strategies like still exist indicative series problems valkyria chronicles brought along itits disappointing see handful qualityoflife issues persist years annoyed first time things like tanks getting caught invisible edges terrain causing waste precious movement points headquarters levelup classes buy new weapons learn new special buffs called orders failing notify new upgrades orders available forcing click every single menu every chapter check new stuffthese means deal breakers ultimately didnt distract much seeing old problems made wish valkyria chronicles hadnt played quite safe returning old ways hearing sound effects even battle music first game great prevents distinct voice trudging clunky old menu layouts wrong turn trip memory laneanother thing thats stayed uneven balance story combat fights last anywhere minutes hour short enough arent daunting still long enough really epic fights truly feel fights usually watch five minutes story cutscenes bit much youre basically alternating commanding fight watching full episode anime thats fairly melodramatic way thats sure familiar anime fans okay knew expect patternvalkyria chronicles takes place time valkyria chronicles completely different perspective war dont need played others jump one halfheartedly tries root characters gallia neutral country games take place making main characters squad federation army doesnt significantly tie gallia story result plot mostly misses opportunity feels disconnected greater story seriesthat said unfolds good war story full love loss lots wellserviced ww tropes overly personal one first game gallias citizens thrown war repel evil empire take back homeland one gallians fighting federation empire baddiesits straightforward war story surface attack enemy win war one seemed bit muddled context games empire unquestionably evil first two valkyria chronicles games establish federation youre fighting isnt really good guy either point addressed valkyria chronicles way still ultimately portrays good guysthis sort thing wont matter someone jumping series first time story still good job making question nuances good evil war still weird control gallians seemed invested federation knowing poorly federation treated gallia rather treating right since first fourth stories happening simultaneously games also little frustrating whole mission youre valkyria chronicles supposedly untold secret story war keeps conveniently disappointingly arms length events weve played previouslywhile eventually became invested soldiers squad e take awhile get point valkyria chronicles doesnt even really introduce main antagonists halfway hour story becomes significantly compelling arent fighting unnamed bad guysacross board halfwayish point feels like moment really see full scope valkyria chronicles get permanent home base clearer objective access cool new systems like able call radar artillery support bulk missions leading still extremely entertaining challenging lack interesting focused goal latter halfanother fantastic new addition eventually unlocks ability promote one squad members leader position otherwise reserved important story characters take units given battle deploy squad active soldiers turn chosen larger pool around first valkyria chronicles impressed gave every one squad members backstory including soldiers theyre friends even never cared using someone else leveling done class character leaves free swap focus whichever characters want decisions based much liked personalities statsbut valkyria chronicles takes idea runs miles farther characters dont backstory actual story squad members show cutscenes alongside main characters every one side mission unlocks use frequently stories tell past grow person buffing new ability processof course thats dont get killed battlefield permadeath easy enough plan avoid youre given time rescue characters get knocked adds real threat hanging characters grew love die dont get cutscenes side missions dont get personality backwithout spoiling anything specific even moment stomach tied knots asked pick soldier special mission might come back literally put controller take moment breath deciding made even impactful every single squad member unique vo specifically pick mission reactions ranging brave pride utter fear extremely powerful touchthe characters generally overthetop anime still relatable enough get attached probably favorite soldier scout named millenia hudson shy women joined war find mia husband whose journey got genuinely teary also quirky characters made smile like shocktrooper named ferrier always wore mysterious iron helmet blonde pigtails sticking engineer name aulard obsessed tanks hilarious degreevalkyria chronicles reuses first games idea framing whole campaign book read war big inspiration behind gorgeous art everything looks like watercolor painting edges screen fade rougher line drawings tactical map looks like actual battlefield map zooming vibrant landscapes still great way sell idea commander soldier little disappointing however roughly twothirds missions take place snow scenes still lovely creatively varied constant greys blues made eventually miss earlier levels vibrant colorsthat stylized art also means valkyria chronicles looks fantastic system choose played full game switch noticed occasional blocky shadows framerate slowdowns particleheavy sections runs smoother higher resolutions though still fps ps xbox one uncapped frame rate resolution pc though limited graphical options mouse keyboard controls work well new tank controls fix touchyness present pc port original

c9b086ea,spongebob squarepants battle bikini bottom rehydrated marks return one iconic licensed characters enter platforming fray sadly flashy remake feels like skindeep remaster practice little fix issues plagued original adventure graphical update accompanied imaginative improvements bright spots arent enough bring battle bikini bottoms passable simplistic collectathonheavy gameplay standard youd expect platformer released especially remakes like crash bandicoot n sane trilogy spyro reignited trilogy showing revival like done october review original battle bikini bottom reviewer mary jane irwin said love spongebob franchise really shines battle bikini bottom werent would dreary title replay nearly years later feels extremely accurate whats dreariest rehydrateds ish hour campaign missed opportunities truly modernize adventure firsttimers us look back fondly alike credit rehydrated runs cleanly playstation pro remastered soundtracks cheery tunes earwormed way mind actual feel running jumping bubbleblowing spongebob precise responsive largely adventure around mechanics admittedly fun enjoyable took advantage spongebob license years debut remains limited scope design overall thoughtfulness many years later back original xbox worse comes added context thoroughly surpassed almost two decades worth amazing platformers f faded memories playing nostalgic platformer remake something ive done quite times ign crash felt fresh n sane trilogy revamped spyros reignited trilogy became fiery new standard thought remakes could playing beloved source material long outlived original games era rehydrated strange place jokes episode references remain kidfriendly largely based earlier seasons show leaving majority series rich comedy deposits untapped theres little fact aside spongebob meme references offer something new returning players like images years since ive watched spongebob pleasantness returning bikini bottom hours occasionally fun even though called remake every conceivable way feels like disappointing remaster psera hangups often getting way remake best modernize improve aspects havent aged well rehydrated rarely every entrance new area saddled seconds load time even going small building like patrick squidwards oneroom homes playstation cant get soon enough three playable characters spongebob sandy patrick repetitive line two dialogue bleat finding collectibles grabbing health hitting enemies first couple times amusing enough hear patricks uncertainty wearing spongebobs underwear th grating th wanted stop playing battle bikini bottom still hits sweet spot absurdist mayhem spongebob episodes often nailed doesnt really work cohesive spongebob episode even movie individual stories already disjointed levels barely present mrs puff barnacle boy deliver great cutting lines go spongebobs head spongebob interpreting paragraphs gary snails meows still joy even someone hasnt watched show ages absolutely jarring one original voice actors doesnt voice iconic character like mr krabs clancy brown absent original still voicing role rehydrated since little new dialogue seemingly recorded u unimaginative gameplay playing battle bikini bottom rehydrated strange roller coaster ride platforming love hate overall incredibly easy platformer truly challenging section thrown welcome challenge levels like spongebobs dream often fun theyre whiplash rest adventure reverts simple final levels like original intermittently swap spongebob sandy patrick often solve characterspecific puzzles rare battle bikini bottom makes interesting use also keep trudging back specific location switch characters instead quickswapping button adds nothing busywork standing easy example something proper remake could addressed playable character ranking lets cut chase sandy easily best character ability slow descend double jump lasso makes infinitely interesting platforming challenges like rooftops downtown bikini bottom spongebob unsurprisingly middle road sandy versatile spongebobs longrange attacks make lategame fights much easier patrick sadly least fun play pick things solve puzzles thats patrick deserves better obsessive collector platformers battle bikini bottom passably makes process nabbing golden spatulas patricks socks engaging challenging every level upfront many item holds perhaps overly clear explaining reach every collectible occasionally robbing joy discovering something ingenuity shiny objects meanwhile infinite youre need thousand hand mr krabs keep intentionally dying respawning convenient spots grind shinies end without consequence n much notably new youre looking replay original battle bikini bottom adventure revisit sporadic bright spots amusing character interactions romp around bikini bottom youll find intact battle bikini bottom still feels generation behind graphical update largely appreciated bright cheery almost neondrenched world feels lot closer energy show title character originals look characters animate well cutscenes care clearly put principal cast locations opposed lifeless denizens bikini bottom walk around serving purpose set dressing iconic locations buildings shift threedimensions much cohesively chunkier forms two console generations ago entire world made vibrant theres occasionally little distinction platforms actually jump set decoration ledges fooled thinking found new secret path character favorite play original battle bikini bottom answer see results spongebob sandy patrick still nice see different neighborhoods bikini bottom brought life dingy rock bottom mermalair bikini bottom spongebobs dream gets play wacky surrealist level design buoyed graphical update made wish entirely new game inspired rather remake unfortunately hollowness world feels stuck earlier incarnation despite plenty bikini bottom residents walking around area interacting nothing silly quips angered screams hit shout leg silence loud reminder could absorbent yellow speedy one aspect battle bikini bottom rehydrated genuinely excited see launch speedrunning communitys reaction dont know original become popular among group finished rehydrated felt like brisk enough pace nowhere near blazingfast time speedrunners accomplished original curious bugs glitches tricks remain exploited whether anything adjusted community contend battle bikini bottom adds new wavebased horde mode lets one person either locally online battle wave wave wave robotic enemies fight campaign isa waste time mode simplistic monotonous unrewarding would poor addition original battle bikini bottom debuted even worse including playable characters dont control campaign nice touch largely play visually different melee ranged attacks sure funny hear squidward use clarinet attack first time like repeated dialogue base game becomes grating hearing times waves devolve little strategy mashing attack corralling swarms enemies easily dispatch ground pound various attacks character really made essentially difference biggest obstacle moreso enemies every waves takes place different island plenty enemy attacks knock surrounding water pretty easily long one player survives round move dying resets wave theres little risk overly aggressive enemies theres little option mode limited completing islands friend three waves took minutes minutes wish could back
